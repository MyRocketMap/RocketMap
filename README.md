![Python 2.7](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-2.7-blue.svg) ![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/RocketMap/RocketMap.svg) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RocketMap/RocketMap.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/RocketMap/RocketMap)

Live visualization of all the pokemon (with option to show gyms and pokestops) in your area. This is a proof of concept that we can load all the pokemon visible nearby given a location. Currently runs on a Flask server displaying Google Maps with markers on it.

## Features:

* Shows Pokemon, Pokestops, and gyms with a clean GUI.
* Notifications
* Lure information
* Multithreaded mode
* Filters
* Independent worker threads (many can be used simulatenously to quickly generate a livemap of a huge geographical area)
* Localization (en, fr, pt_br, de, ru, ko, ja, zh_tw, zh_cn, zh_hk)
* DB storage (sqlite or mysql) of all found pokemon
* Incredibly fast, efficient searching algorithm (compared to everything else available)

## Installation
I would not install unless you know what you are doing!

For instructions on how to setup and run the original tool, please refer to the project [documentation](https://rocketmap.readthedocs.io).

Building off [tejado's python pgoapi](https://github.com/tejado/pgoapi), [Mila432](https://github.com/Mila432/Pokemon_Go_API)'s API, [leegao's additions](https://github.com/leegao/pokemongo-api-demo/tree/simulation) and [Flask-GoogleMaps](https://github.com/rochacbruno/Flask-GoogleMaps). Current version relies primarily on the pgoapi and Google Maps JS API.
